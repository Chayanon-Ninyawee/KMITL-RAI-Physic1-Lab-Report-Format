\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is Newton’s Second Law of Motion?  % NOTE: EXAMPLE QUESTION

	      Newton’s Second Law states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration:
	      \[
		      F = ma
	      \]

	\item Define the term “free fall”.  % NOTE: EXAMPLE QUESTION

	      Free fall is the motion of an object solely under the influence of gravity, assuming no air resistance.

	\item Calculate the acceleration of an object in free fall.  % NOTE: EXAMPLE QUESTION

	      Since air resistance is neglected, the acceleration is due to gravity:
	      \[
		      a = g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2
	      \]

	\item What is the difference between mass and weight?  % NOTE: EXAMPLE QUESTION

	      Mass is the amount of matter in an object, measured in kilograms.
	      Weight is the gravitational force acting on the mass:
	      \[
		      W = mg
	      \]
